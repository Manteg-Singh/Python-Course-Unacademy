# We will see different data types in python

# 1. Integer

# An integer can be positive negative or zero
x = 10
print(x, type(x)) # it will first print the value of x and then data type of x

# 2. Float
# This is used to represent decimal values in python

y = 23.4
print(y, type(y)) # it will first print the value of y and then data type of y

# 3. Boolean
# This is just used to store eithe True or False

b = True
print(b, type(b))

# 4. String
# This is used to store text

string_with_single = 'qwerty'
string_with_double = "asdfgh"
string_with_triple = '''zxcvb'''
multi_line_string = '''
This is a
multiline
string
'''

print(string_with_single, string_with_double, string_with_triple, multi_line_string)

# 5. Character
# In python character doesn't exist separately, we can make a string of one length

ch = 'a'
print(ch)

# 6. Complex Number
# Stores complex number

comp = 2 + 3j
print(comp, type(comp))
